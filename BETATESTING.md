#HOW TO TEST

We need beta testers to test our system against players.    
Not only do beta testers need to check if they can't to permitted commands etc.    
But also think outside the box.    
    
*Issues/Bugreports of commands not listed in README.md will be removed from the Issue Tracker!*    
*When a command is listed on README.md it is `expected` to work, and we need to make that sure*    
    
#HOW TO REPORT AN ISSUE (OR TO SUGGEST SOMETHING NEW, ALSO WELCOME)

Create a new issue on the **Issue Tracker**    
    
**MAKE SURE TO USE THE RIGHT LABEL FOR THE ISSUE IN GITHUB ISSUE TRACKER** *This helps with priority*    
    
if it is `unwanted behaviour` (when something does not work like it should, *but does not break things*) please list:    
 - What happens	   
 - How it should happen    
    
if it is a `bug` (when something does not work right *and causes things to break*) please list:    
 - The *exact steps* you did in order to cause that bug
 - Any chat output if that can

if is is an `error` (when something happens *that causes an error message and termination of script)
 - Exact steps at `bug`
 - The error message from Custom NPCs console

if it is an `suggestion`
 - It will be looked into
 - Eventually `ruled-out` or accepted and on `todo`
 
if it is an `question`
(Make sure if your question is not asked earlier and not on Discord!)
 - It will be looked into

 
And regarding beta testing, we check on `quality` not `quantity`!
